-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes between Oolite 1.75.3 and Oolite 1.76:

Gameplay:

--------
* When using docking clearance, player now gets an extra few seconds when very
  close to the dock. (Bug #17997)
* Enhanced missile logic for missiles approaching head-on to a target.

  computers with non-standard resolutions.
* Fixed the game screen getting resized to the size of the splash screen.
* Fixed the player ship going crazy when switching to mouse controls.
* Various keyboard fixes to ensure keys are correctly mapped.


Expansion pack development changes:
===================================

Ships:
------

Equipment:
----------
* The plasma cannon now uses the 'weapon_position_' keys from shipdata.plist.
* Weapon names are now always displayed as "<position> <type> laser", 
  irrespective of what is defined in equipment.plist and descriptions.plist.

Other Configuration Files:
--------------------------
* Script names are no longer expanded unless enclosed by [] in mission text
  or mission info.
* Resizing message_gui & comms_log_gui via hud.plists now retains the
  comms log and the last 2 message lines.
* Added the key to turn the HUD on and off to keyconfig.plist (default: 'o').
* A wrongly defined 'titleKey' for missionScreens now logs a warning instead
  of an internal error.

Javascript:
-----------
* Fixed rounding errors for the "angleTo" method which sometimes returned
  a NaN for identical vectors instead of zero.
* Fixed the "rotationTo" method which sometimes returned an illegal
  quaternion for some anti-parallel vectors.
* Fixed "isValid" for entities which were destroyed during the current
  game tick; always returns 'false' now.
* system.addShip() & system.addGroup() now only returns the ships
  actually added to the Universe, instead of the whole group.
* viewDirectionChanged() now fires correctly when switching between
  gui screens.
* The "startUp" event should now fire properly after the Universe is
  fully initialised.
* Fixed reliability of the Javascript engine when resetting itself.

* The frameCallback is now only called when the game is actually running.
* When the player aborts a jump countdown, the type of the jump is now
  reported.

Scripting bug fixes:
--------------------
* Regression fix: the legacy_spawnShip function should work again.
* system.name, system.population, etc. should now report the correct values
  when in interstellar space.
* Changes to system.name, system.techLevel, etc. are now shown correctly on
  the short range map.
* ships should now always have the correct orientation after being spawned.
* restoring sub-entities on the player ship now adjusts the trade-in factor
  correctly.
* The AI commands 'becomeExplosion' and 'becomeEnergyBlast' now also trigger
  the shipDied event handler.
* The game no longer freezes when a script tries to resurrect a ship after
  it dies; the ship just dies now. (Bug #18054)
* Specifying 0Cr mandatory equipments no longer freezes the game.
* Specifying illegal flasher declaration no longer causes an exception.

New AI properties and methods:
------------------------------
* checkHeatInsulation - returns either INSULATION_OK or INSULATION_POOR.

OXP Verifier:
-------------
* Fixed bug in the oxp-Verifyer not recognizing 'escorts' in shipdata.
* Added CLASS_MINE to the oxpVerifier.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes between Oolite 1.75.2 and Oolite 1.75.3:

* Subentities are now set up correctly when buying a new ship.
* Ships now take subentities into account when deciding whether they can dock.
* Fixed ghost wormholes. Wormholes can no longer have a jump range of zero.
* The fuel indicator is now drawn correctly in interstellar space.
* Additional guards against out-of-range targets for the player.
* Sounds now stop playing when starting a new game. (Bug #18108)
* [Mac] Growl display support is disabled due to upcoming changes to Growl.

  log, and AIs can handle the situation by responding to NO_SUN_FOUND.
* "sunskim-trader" added to default pirate victim roles.
* interstellar_undocking now works when in interstellar space 0 LY from a
  system.
* HUD changes are now deferred, so changing HUDs during HUD drawing is safe.
* The debugging function callObjC() has been disabled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes between Oolite 1.75.1 and Oolite 1.75.2:

* New Linux/POSIX installer.
* Disabled shaders on certain ATi GPUs using Gallium drivers because of crashes.
* Clock adjustments now accumulate in the obvious way (Bug #17969).
* Improved texture filtering for planets and generated emission maps (in non-
  shader mode).
* Fixed bug where a ship was apparently attacking itself whenever one of its
  subentities was taking energy damage.
* Friendly fire between ships in the same group, and between police, military
  or thargoid vessels, no longer leads to hostilities.
* Ships following the player through a wormhole now have jump rings.
* Ships with beacon codes now retain them after jumping to a new system.
  (Bug #18068)
* Fixes to mass-dependent fuel pricing.
* Fixed mouse control starting in yaw mode. (Bug #18052)
* Descriptions.plist strings are now scanned for "%n", which could be used
  maliciously on GNUstep systems.
* New AI message: ACCEPTED_ESCORT.

* Fixed scripted misjumps not working when set from within the
  shipWillEnterWitchspace handler for wormholes created by NPCs.
* NPCs in interstellar space can now jump back to their origin system.
  (Bug #18082, partial)
* Scripts can no longer give the player an out-of-range target. (Bug #18011)
* Q-mines awarded to NPCs in flight now work. (More accurately, q-mines for
  NPCs used to be represented internally as EQ_ENERGY_BOMB instead of
  EQ_QC_MINE.)

Known bugs:
* Intermittent crashes when removing pylon-mounted equipment
  (http://www.aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=9761)
* Freeze when script resurrects a ship being killed by a Q-bomb (Bug #18054)
* AI crash triggered by large groups of thargoids (Bug #18055)
* Bugs related to repeated misjumps (Bug #18082)
* Unhelpful docking clearance behaviour changing priorities when a ship is on
  final approach (Bug #17997)
* Fuel indicator is not drawn correctly in interstellar space (Bug #18097)
* Q-bomb explosions are not drawn properly on some systems (Bug #17276)
* In some conditions, the "break pattern" effect is drawn off-centre.
* Problem with roles of tharglets used as subentities (Bug #17979)
* Problem with frame callbacks and jumps (Bug #17956)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes between Oolite 1.75 and Oolite 1.75.1:

* Joystick deadzone restored to previous value (Mac OS X not affected).
  (Bug #17945)
* (Mac OS X) Support for game pads that don't pretend to be joysticks.
* (Windows) Uninstaller is now more discriminating about which files it deletes.
* The fast docking button now defaults to the main station if within the aegis,
  even if it's outside scanner range, as intended. (Bug #17923)
* Ship mass calculations, and thus mass lock behaviour, have been restored
  (except for very small ships). (Bug #17940)
* Thargoids no longer randomly shoot in entirely the wrong direction.
* Fixed "jousting" behaviour where attacking ships would veer off after one hit.
* Various fixes for wormhole behaviour in interstellar space, post-nova systems
  and with ships with escorts.
* Interim fix for mass-dependent fuel prices not working. (Bug #17947)
* Various bug fixes and cosmetic tweaks, including but not limited to bugs
  #17944, #17968, #17975, #17992, #17993, and #17995.

JavaScript:
* JavaScript Ship equipmentStatus() now works for primary and secondary weapons.
* Calling spawn() on a subentity previously put the spawnees near the
  witchpoint. It now works like calling spawn() on the parent ship, which is
  suboptimal but less confusing. Relying on the current behaviour is not
  recommended as it may be improved in future.
* JavaScript system.addShipsToRoute() now adds ships within scanner range of
  the route, and ships added with system.addGroupToRoute() are clustered.
* JavaScript SystemInfo systemsInRange() once again works as an instance method
  (which is now the recommended usage).
* New ship event entityDestroyed(). This fires immediately after the ship
  becomes invalid, regardless of the reason, except when the game restarts.
* New SystemInfo property internalCoordinates and new PlayerShip properties
  cursorCoordinatesInLY, galacticHyperspaceFixedCoordsInLY and
  galaxyCoordinatesInLY. This resolves the problem that different coordinate
  systems were being used for galactic coordinates in different contexts.
* Mission screens can now be run in flight without generating warnings about
  the player being both docked and not docked. (Bug #17953)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes between Oolite 1.74.2 and Oolite 1.75:

Gameplay:
* Smarter, more aggressive NPCs - for example, they are now able to shoot you
  when you cunningly stand still.
* New master weapon lock key (default: _) disables primary and secondary
  weapons, and turrets.
* Simplified autopilot controls: C (or key_autopilot) attempts to autopilot-
  dock with the current target station - your target if any, otherwise a
  station within scanner range, favouring the main station. Shift-C (now
  key_autodock instead of key_autopilot_target) is the same, except it will
  fast-dock if permitted. Shift-D is no longer used.
* New "primable equipment" concept: equipment can produce scripted effects
  without having to be a missile. New keys: Shift-N and Control-Shift-N cycle
  through the list of primable equipment, and N activates the currently selected
  equipment. (Key config keys: key_prime_equipment, key_activate_equipment.)
* Target-sensitive reticle mode is now more accurate.
* Fuel price now depends on the mass of your ship.
* Jumping between overlapping systems now uses 0.1 LY worth of fuel.
* A hyperspace misjump now takes 3/4 of the time of a successful jump, rather
  than the full time. (It has to be at least 3/4 to avoid exploits. See
  http://aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?t=7917 for more information.)
* The trumble offer "mission" now repeats as intended, in case you accidentally
  missed it.
* Escape pods now aim for the nearest friendly station/carrier.
* The escape pod key/joystick button must now be pressed twice in rapid
  succession to eject (except in strict mode, or if the
  escape-pod-activation-immediate hidden setting is set).
* Comm log messages are now spoken. (Feature request #4970)

Bug fixes:
* "Lollipop flashes" eliminated. (Bug #17215)
* Hyperspace countdown messages don't repeat themselves.
* You can no longer sneak into the contract screen through the back door in
  secondary stations.
* Secondary weapons are now accounted for properly when evaluating your ship.
  (Bug #17450)
* Fixes to joystick configuration (Bug #17482, Bug #17490)
* The usual indescribable yet important "minor tweaks and fixes".

Miscellaneous:
* New icon by seventh.
* Reduced memory usage of various special effects and JavaScript objects. On
  the other hand, the new JavaScript engine uses more memory.

Mac-specific:
* The Dread Sound Bug of Doom is fixed. (Bug #17214)
* Joystick support.
* Automatic update support (Sparkle).
* The Oolite Screen Shots folder can now be moved from the desktop and Oolite
  will continue to use it (as long as it isn't renamed or moved to the trash).

Windows and Linux:
* Due to a bug in GNUstep, older versions cannot read credit balances of more
  than 429496729.5 credits correctly. 1.75 writes saved games in a way that
  avoids this problem (even when loaded with old test releases). The Windows
  version can also read larger credit quantities in old saved games.


Expansion pack development changes:
Ships:
* New shipdata.plist keys:
  - allows_auto_docking (station only): if true, player autopilot docking is
    permitted. Default: true.
  - allows_fast_docking (station only): if true, fast docking is permitted.
    Default: false, except for main station.
  - counts_as_kill: if false, the ship does not count as a kill and does not
    participate in q-mine cascade happy fun time, even if its scan class and
    other properties would otherwise let it do so. Default: true.
  - cloak_automatic (NPCs): if true, cloaking device is activated when
    attacking; otherwise, it must be activated by a script. Default: true.
  - has_patrol_ships (station only, fuzzy boolean): if true, the station will
    periodically launch patrols if it has any police ships docked. Default:
    false, but ignored (treated as always true) for main station.
  - hyperspace_motor (all ships, including player): required to be able to
    jump. Default: true.
  - interstellar_undocking (station only): if true, docking with the station in
    interstellar space doesn't cause the station to jump to an adjacent system.
    Default: false.
  - weapon_range (turret subentities): plasma shot range. Default: 6000.
  - tunnel_corners, tunnel_start_angle and tunnel_aspect_ratio (station only):
    these replace docking_pattern_model. See
    http://www.aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?p=128823#p128823 for more
    information.
* A new ship role, "cinder", is used to generate debris in post-nova systems.
  The default cinders look like the default asteroids and boulders, but have
  very high heat shielding. If you make custom asteroids, you probably want to
  make cinder versions of them. If you're abusing the "asteroid" role to put
  random stuff in asteroid fields, you don't want to make a cinder version.
* Turret weapon_energy now defaults to 25.
* Beacon icon data is now handled in a more flexible way
  (http://aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?p=128487#p128487; Bug #17828).
  Additionally, it is looked up using the ship's beacon code as a key, instead
  of its primary role.

Equipment:
* New equipment.plist extra-dictionary keys:
  - script: used to implement primable equipment. Equipment scripts have one
    predefined property, equipmentKey, and one event handler, activated().
  - visible: controls visibility on status screen and shipyard blurbs.
    Default: true.
* NPC missiles are now represented as equipment entries instead of ships. For
  efficiency, it is recommended that all NPC missile types have an
  equipment.plist entry, even if they're not available to the player. (For
  example, there is now an EQ_THARGON.) For assistance in setting this up,
  enable ship.setUp.missiles in logcontrol.plist (or use
  console.setDisplayMessagesInClass("ship.setUp.missiles", true) in the debug
  console).

Other configuration files:
* Sounds that are listed in customsounds.plist are now preloaded to avoid
  loading delays. Sounds that are played through JavaScript by specifying a
  file name cannot be preloaded; if you're doing this, and your sound isn't
  particularly rare, I suggest going through a customsounds.plist entry.
* Fortuitously, using customsounds.plist entries from scripts now works
  properly.
* Screen backdrops and overlays can now be scaled, allowing for higher
  resolutions. (Bug #17201) See http://aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?p=127716
  for more information. Additionally, screenbackgrounds.plist entries may be
  arrays, in which case one element is picked at random.
* Planets using cube map textures now rotate around the expected polar axis.
  Planets using traditional textures don't, but they never did. (Bug #17243)
* New HUD dial selector: drawWeaponsOfflineText:.

JavaScript:
* Upgraded SpiderMonkey to bleeding edge (1.75 uses the same version as
  FireFox 4.0 beta 11). This adds most ECMAScript 5th Edition features, notably
  including strict mode, which I recommend all OXPers adopt.
* On the other hand, the old SpiderMonkey-specific "strict mode" is disabled by
  default because it has some false positives. It can be enabled through the
  debug console by setting console.pedanticMode to true.
* Native JSON support may be useful for storing structured data in mission
  variables.
* The JavaScript global and console objects are now replaced when resetting the
  game, and can no longer be used to smuggle information across sessions.
* Vector3D and Quaternion objects can no longer be compared using == and !=,
  because the wart in the JavaScript engine we were previously exploiting no
  longer exists. See http://www.aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=8847 for
  more information.
* Scripts are now stopped if they run for more than one second. (Slow Oolite
  functions are not counted towards the limit. The idea isn't to force a time
  limit on you but to kill scripts stuck in an infinite loop. If your script
  is deliberately running for more than a second you probably have problems,
  though.) During loading and the startUp event, the limit is two seconds.
* All Oolite-provided JavaScript methods and properties have been audited for
  consistent error reporting and sane handling of bad values. In some cases,
  their error checking has become stricter. In others, they perform normal
  implicit conversions (like converting a string with a numerical value to a
  number) instead of failing or crashing. All normal parameter errors should
  now become JavaScript exceptions; calling an Oolite-defined method with the
  wrong type of this value will just halt the script, but it's hard to do that
  by accident.
* Oolite now has the ability to write a stack trace when a JavaScript exception
  goes unhandled or a warning is logged. This helps you find out how you
  reached the point where the error occurs. This is on by default if the debug
  OXP is installed, off by default otherwise. You can toggle it by setting
  console.dumpStackForErrors and console.dumpStackForWarnings if the console is
  active, or the dump-stack-for-errors and dump-stack-for-warnings hidden
  settings otherwise. When the console is active, you can also log a stack
  trace at any point using the special statement debugger;, which will
  otherwise have no effect.
* The JavaScript global object is now exposed as a property of itself, called
  global. global === global.global.
* The player's ship is now treated as invalid after ejecting or dying.
* Some exceptions thrown in event handlers, which were mistakenly suppressed
  before, are now reported.
* Frame callbacks: callback functions that are called once per frame, useful
  for driving animations. See http://aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=8941
  for more information.

Scripting bug fixes:
* The prototype chains for Oolite-defined objects were previously set up
  incorrectly. This has been fixed. An effect of this is that using methods and
  properties on singleton constructors instead of their instances stopped
  working. For the most common cases, System and Player there are compatibility
  accessors which log warning, much like we've done for deprecated methods in
  the past. If you want to actually understand what's going on, my best stab at
  explaining it is at http://www.aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=8968 .
* As far as scripts are concerned, the player can now only die once.
  (Previously, shipDied() would be called twice, once without parameters and
  once with.)
* When the player is killed by a q-bomb, the damageType parameter to shipDied()
  is now "cascade weapon" (not "energy damage").
* You can now award multiple trumbles, to the delight of customers everywhere.
* "Display models" of ships and planets no longer show up in the system's
  entity lists. You can get at the display model for mission screens with the
  new mission.displayModel property. The others are intended to be inaccessible.
* Sound.load() now handles customsounds.plist keys properly.
* Ship exitSystem()/AI performHyperSpaceExit now work in interstellar space.

New world events:
* playerWillSaveGame(saveType) (Feature request #5095)
* escapePodSequenceOver() (called immediately before deciding how to rescue or
  kill the player after using an escape pod. See
  player.setEscapePodDestination()).

New ship events:
* coordinatesForEscortPosition(index) (not exactly an event, but whatever.)
* distressMessageReceived(aggressor, sender)
* shipTakingDamage(amount, fromEntity, damageType) (Feature request #5077)
* shipKilledOther(target, damageType) (fires after target's shipDied(), but
  before actually blowing up).
* shipWillLaunchFromStation(station) (previously restricted to player).

Modified ship events:
* commsMessageReceived() now takes a second parameter, the sending ship.

New JavaScript properties and methods:
* Entity collisionRadius
* Entity dumpState() (only available if console is active): writes a bunch of
  junk to the log.
* EquipmentInfo canBeDamaged
* EquipmentInfo canCarryMultiple
* EquipmentInfo isAvailableToNPCs

* Global defaultFont (object with one method, measureString())
* Global addFrameCallback()
* Global formatCredits()
* Global formatInteger()
* Global isValidFrameCallback()
* Global removeFrameCallback()
* Global takeSnapShot()
* mission.displayModel: the spinning-ship backdrop, if one is in use. (If you
  set spinModel to false in the runScreen() parameter object, it will refrain
  from spinning around for easier manual animation.)
* player.setEscapePodDestination()
* player.ship.viewDirection
* player.ship.weaponsOnline
* player.ship.removePassenger()
* Ship subEntityCapacity
* Ship restoreSubentities()
* Ship scriptedMisjump() (previously player-only)
* Station allowsAutoDocking
* Station allowsFastDocking
* System countEntitiesWithScanClass()
* System scrambledPseudoRandomNumber()

Modified JavaScript properties and methods:
* Ship commsMessage() now takes an optional second parameter, the target ship.
* Ship equipmentStatus() now returns "EQUIPMENT_UKNOWN" when passed an
  undefined equipment identifier, instead of throwing an exception.
* The Ship property roleProbabilities has been renamed roleWeights.

New AI commands:
* enterPlayerWormhole
* setDesiredRangeForWaypoint
* setTargetToNearestFriendlyStation
* thargonCheckMother
* updateEscortFormation

New AI messages:

    (possibly) work.
  - autopilot-cannot-dock-with-target - still included, but currently unused.

Debug console:
* Previously, the console object was available from within the console as
  console, and anywhere else as debugConsole. Both are now global, and console
  is preferred.
* Profiling support: call :profile <expression> to see where <expression>
  spends its time. For more detailed information, as a bunch of JavaScript
  objects rather than a text dump, use
  this.profileData = console.getProfile(function() { <expression> }).
* Tracing support: call :trace <expression> to see the hierarchy of function
  calls made by <expression>. (The trace is written to the log.) Tracing and
  profiling can't be used at the same time.
* When the result of an expression is an array or plain object, its structure
  is now pretty-printed. You can also pretty-print the structure of any object
  using the :d <expression> macro. I suggest getting into the habit of doing
  this to any object you're curious about. :d player.ship is a good starting
  point.
* The call() method has been renamed callObjC() to avoid confusion with the
  standard Function.prototype.call(). It now works on more objects - just about
  everything except vectors and quaternions - and can deal with Objective-C
  methods that return numbers, vectors or quaternions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes between Oolite 1.74.1 and Oolite 1.74.2:

* Stopped player from selecting invalid jump destination during jump countdown.
* Fixed docking permissions inconsistencies: all hostile stations now refuse
  docking permissions.
* Switching to custom views now allowed in a consistent way.
* Weapon repeat rate is now per-weapon.
* Current zoom level is now preserved when switching HUDs.
* Exhaust plume now resets after hyperspace jumps/scripted teleporting/auto-
  docking.
* Fixed overlapping system confusion when loading games and searching for
  systems.
* All automatically generated sun skimmers should now be adequately shielded.
* Fixed occasional “bleached”-looking planets on system info screen.
* Fixed wrong distance showing on the short range chart when switching back
  from the long range chart.
* Improved default speech synthesis voice (not Mac OS X).
* SystemInfo.systemsInRange() can now be called on a specific SystemInfo object,
  instead of always applying to the current system.
* New JavaScript event: shipAttackedOther() (inverse of shipBeingAttacked(),
  called immediately after shipBeingAttacked()).
* If a script removes a piece of equipment in the equipmentDamaged() event
  handler, no “equipment damaged” message is generated.
* Ship.removeEquipment() now works on damaged equipment.
* Fixed substitution priority for expandDescription() and expandMissionText(),
  the local override dictionary now takes precedence over everything else.
* New shipinfo key: station_roll.
* Fixed some cases where AIs could break group handling.
* Shader errors detected in the link phase (generally, problems involving state
  shared between the vertex and fragment shader) are now reported properly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes between Oolite 1.74 and Oolite 1.74.1:

* Scripts can once again award and check for trumbles, and the standard trumble
  mission once again works. (Limitation: scripts cannot increase the number of
  trumbles by awarding more. This will be fixed in 1.75.)
* The nova mission once again awards the appropriate reward on a successful
  outcome.
* No more "Witchspace engine malfunction" message when entering a post-nova
  system.
* When docked at a secondary station, the default selection on the game menu
  screen is "Game Options" rather than "Begin New Game".
* Fixed annoying audio latency when playing first sound under Mac OS X.
* Fixed several JavaScript interface bugs that could cause a faulty script to
  halt without any error message.
* Adjusted graphics settings: shader mode is now restricted to Simple for
  Intel GMA 950 and ATI Radeon R300 GPU families, and some other tweaks.
* Fixed a material synthesis bug where illumination_modulate_color was ignored
  when using emission_and_illumination_map in shader mode (material test suite
  test case 7).
* Possible fix for random freezes when using speech synthesis in Windows.
* Various minor bug fixes and tweaks.

New JavaScript methods:
* vector3D.fromCoordinateSystem()
* vector3D.toCoordinateSystem()

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes between Oolite 1.73.4 and Oolite 1.74:

Gameplay
* With the Advanced Navigation Array you can now see the fastest (as opposed
  to shortest) route by pressing control-shift-6 (Mac: control-^).
* Mouse control (full screen mode only) can be enabled with a yaw-and-pitch
  flight model by pressing control-shift-M. (As before, shift-M will use a
  roll-pitch model.)
* The ECM alarm no longer goes of while you’re docked.
* The "Missile/Mine armed" message now specifies what type of missile/mine it
  is.
* Greatly improved traffic control dialogues.
* Speech synthesis is now available on all platforms.
* Improved behaviour on various menu screens.
* When dying, the last saved game is now reloaded. (In strict mode, the game
  restarts.)
* Auto-saves are now named "Commander Name (autosave)" instead of just
  "autosave". There is no auto-save immediately after restarting.

Graphics
* The default shader mode is now Full except on first-generation shader-
  capable systems. Full shader mode will be disabled on some or all of those
   systems in future, but is currently enabled for testing purposes.
* [Mac] Enabled "Detailed Planets" option.
* Flashers and particle effects look better. Very large flashers no longer pop
   into view at unexpectedly close range.
* Reduced aliasing artefacts ("twinkling") in star field and distant flashers/
  particles.
* Many of the built-in ships have been edited to fix minor lighting issues.
* Light maps are now supported in shaderless mode (on systems that support
  "texture combiners").
* Improved specular highlights in shaderless mode on most systems.
* Hyperspace and dock tunnels look different.
* [Linux] Fixed tearing issues (v-sync).
* Shader mode changes now take effect immediately.
* "Pink oceans" are no longer a lie.

Bug fixes
* Lasers now hit the right shield, even if they happen to be fired by
  subentities.
* No more messages about broken equipment, lost targets and so forth after you
  die.
* Fixed lighting issues for objects with shaders, notably demo screen and
  shipyard lighting, and shadows.
* Fixed blocked docking queue when ships in the queue die.
* The game now distinguishes between overlapping systems properly.
* Hot ships now dump hot cargo (and escape pods).
* Ships can no longer be sold with both types of energy unit (the regular one
  is removed).
* [Mac] Full screen mode is once again restored when relaunching as
  appropriate.
* [Mac] No longer freezes indefinitely while waiting for iTunes to respond if,
  say, you have a dialog box open in iTunes.
* Collisions are now reported to both ships involved.
* It is now possible to use the same mesh with and without smoothing.
* Callbacks passed to Oolite JavaScript methods can now access variables in
  the enclosing context.
* JavaScript scripts can no longer survive the transition to strict mode
  (except by attaching themselves to the debug console).
* Lots of boring little crashes, log messages and things. Many lots.

Known bugs
* Planets' axes of rotation can now be messed up in several new ways. There is
  still no un-messed-up option. (Bug #17243)
* Scooping is too hard. (Bug #17245)
* Exhaust plumes jump around stupidly after a jump. (Bug #17246)
* New substitution dictionary parameter to expandDescription()/
  expandMissionText() has lower priority than description.plist entries,
  should be higher. (Bug #17193)
* Overlays and underlays have a fixed resolution and interact badly with
  texture rescaling. (Bug #17201, technically old)
* Shot cycle times depend on the last weapon fired, not the currently selected
  weapon.  (Bug #17240, old)
* Scanner markers appear in the wrong place for one frame when summoning an
  NPC ship.  (Bug #17215, old)
* When overriding a market system-wide ("market" entry in planetinfo.plist),
  the specified market is applied to all stations in the system, not just the
  main station as was most likely intended. (Bug #17247, old)
* [Mac] Occasional bursts of very loud noise, causing the system to compensate
  by lowering effective volume.  (Bug #17214, old)

Remember, if it isn’t in the bug tracker, we officially don’t know about it.

Miscellaneous
* Decreased memory usage, primarily for flashers and textures.
* The log file is a bit more readable.
* [Mac and Windows] Add-ons, log and screen shots can now be found through
  menus.
* Added support for working around specific 3D hardware issues. In particular,
  the default shader setting is now hardware-dependent, and point and line
  smoothing are disabled on some hardware.
* [Mac] Oolite now requires Mac OS X 10.4 or later.
* [Mac] Oolite is now 64-bit clean in Mac OS X 10.6.
* [Windows and Linux]: Screenshots are now saved in PNG format.

OXP/scripting
* New mission screen model: use mission.runScreen(), ignore everything else.
  Generally, use missionScreenOpportunity() event to run mission screens.
  Several of the old mission properties and methods are deprecated. See
  http://www.aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?t=6860 for details.
* All ships now have "real" equipment that can be manipulated through scripts,
  not just the player. Several new equipment-related methods and properties
  have been added. Damage status is separated from equipment type (no more
  _DAMAGED suffixes in JavaScript). ship.hasEquipment() has been deprecated.
* Script state no longer persists when the game resets/reloads. In particular,
  the reset() event is gone; instead, scripts are reloaded from scratch and
  startUp() is called again. Also, the ability to create "persistent" timers
  that survived resets is gone.
* Background and overlay images: can be set with screenbackground.plist or
  setScreenBackground() and setScreenOverlay() functions.
* Whitelisting is now fully in effect: unpermitted methods in legacy scripts,
  AIs or HUD dial definitions will be ignored.
* The "homebrew" plist parser has been removed.
* Ship.remove() now takes an optional boolean parameter, suppressDeathEvent.
  If true, the ship will not be sent a shipDied() event (and death_actions
  will not fire.) A new event, shipRemoved(), is sent regardless (before
  shipDied()).
* The shipLaunchedFromStation() event now passes the station as a parameter.
* New context string for shipDied(): "cascade weapon".
* JS timers stop if their callback’s "this" object (the first parameter to the
  constructor) dies.
* expandDescription() and the new expandMissionText() can optionally be passed
  a dictionary of substitution pairs, as in:
  expandDescription("My ball is [my_color].", { "my_color": "red" });
  Bug: at the moment, description.plist values take precedence. In 1.74.1,
  this will be reversed.
* Ship models can now include per-vertex normals, so you can import models
  with smooth parts directly from a real live 3D editor. Unfortunately tangent
  generation for such files is completely broken, so they can’t be normal
  mapped at the moment.
* Flashers are now taken into account when determining a ship’s cull distance.
  This means ships with ridiculous giant flashers are now seen from much
  further away. It also means they affect performance from much further away.
  Also, distant flashers fade out rather than suddenly disappearing.
* Player ships with player-only shader bindings can now be displayed on the
  demo screen and shipyard screen without causing errors. (The same fix also
  applies to the doppelganger created when the player ejects.)
* Ship "personality" numbers and "random" shader uniforms are now generated in
  a consistent fashion for the player, and transferred from the display model
  when buying ships. This means player ship shaders can usefully use "random"
  parameters.
* Cube map textures are now supported - especially useful for, but not limited
  to, planets.
* Greyscale+alpha PNG textures are now supported.
* Changes to material model: renamed diffuse, specular, ambient and emission
  to diffuse_color, specular_color, ambient_color and emission_color. (The old
  names are still supported for compatibility.) Added specular_modulate_color
  and emission_modulate_color, and added illumination_modulate_color; these
  are used to recolour the corresponding texture maps (specular and emission
  used to do this, but are now only used when there’s no texture map). See
  http://www.aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?p=109378#109378 for details.
* It is now possible for a texture to be specified as a specific channel of a
  file, as in { name = "my_texture.png"; extract_channel = "r"; };. This comes
  with some overhead, but makes it easy to reuse channels of shader effect
  maps as emission or illumination maps in non-shader mode.
* Shaders no longer have implicit tex0, tex1 etc. uniforms. Easily fixed:
  uniforms = ( tex0 = { type = "texture"; value = 0; }, ... );
* Subentities and flashers can now be specified as dictionaries instead of
  non-descriptive strings.
* Flashers with a frequency of 0 now always have full intensity.
  (Previously, it was always 0.5.)
* Using the new dictionary-type definition, flashers can now be any colour.
  They can also take an array of colours and switch between them in sequence.
  Use black to create intermittent flashers.
* Ship radar marker colours can be specified in shipdata.plist as
  scanner_display_color1 and scanner_display_color2, and in JavaSCript as
  scannerDisplayColor1 and scannerDisplayColor2.
* The ship property cargo_carried can now be set to "SCARCE_GOODS" or
  "PLENTIFUL_GOODS". The selected goods then depend on the prices at the local
  market.
* Improved missile HUD icons. Outlines are now of consistent thickness.
  Arbitrary concave and complex (self-intersecting) polygons are supported,
  and more than one contour may be used (by specifying an array of arrays). To
  maximise compatibility with existing missiles, the relatively obscure
  Positive polygon winding rule is used; you can punch holes by using polygons
  with opposite winding order to the first one. Convex corners are bevelled at
  30° or sharper angles. For troubleshooting, use the polygon-sprite-dump-svg
  hidden setting (http://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/Hidden_Settings_in_Oolite).
* Support for HUD "dial" for joystick sensitivity,
  drawStickSensitivityIndicator:. See comment in hud.plist.
* HUD elements can be adapted to window aspect ratio using the new x_origin
  and y_origin properties. -1 is bottom/left, 1 is top/right, 0 (default) is
  centre.
* HUD elements can have their alpha modified individually.
* New OXPMessages.plist to put notifications on the startup screen.
* New generate-ai-graphviz hidden preference
  (http://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/Hidden_Settings_in_Oolite) to dump flow
  control graphs for AIs.
* NPC missiles are now associated with equipment types (so that appropriate
  EquipmentInfo objects can be used to describe them). If no equipment.plist
  entry exists, an EquipmentInfo will be synthesised as needed.
* Carrier AIs now receive DOCKING_REQUESTED and DOCKING_COMPLETE messages in
  connection with docking clearance requests.
* New CARGO_DUMPED AI message.
* Overheating behaviour changed as per
  http://aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?t=6922.
* Giving player a trumble may fail if they already have some.
* Better error reporting in various situations.

New world events:
* compassTargetChanged()

* missionScreenOpportunity()
* shipSpawned() (Sent immediately after ship event of the same name)

New ship events:
* shipCloakActivated()
* shipCloakDeactivated()

* mission.runMissionScreen() - convert to mission.runScreen().
* mission.showShipModel() - convert to mission.runScreen().
* mission.setBackgroundImage() - convert to mission.runScreen().

* timer.isPersistent - no replacement.

New/modified shipdata keys:
* auto_ai (fuzzy boolean, default: true): now applies to escorts.
* cloak_passive (boolean, default false): if true, ship’s cloak is disabled
  when firing weapons.
* debris_role (role, default "boulder" or "splinter"): specifies the type of
  debris generated when an asteroid or boulder breaks up.
* docking_pattern_model (DAT file name): replace docking effect model (see the
  rock hermit for an example).
* has_scoop_message  (boolean, default true): if false, the standard
  "<something> scooped." message is suppressed when this ship is scooped.
* market (commodities.plist key): for carriers, specifies the commodity market
  to use.
* max_missiles (number, default: same value as "missiles"): now applies to NPC
  ships.
* missile_load_time (number, default 0): specifies the minimum interval
  between missile shots.
* scanner_display_color1, scanner_display_color2 (colour specifiers, default:
  depends on scan class): see above.
* Inconsistent shipdata keys "escort-role", "escort-ship", "hasShipyard",
  "isCarrier" and "scanClass" have been supplemented with idiomatic
  "escort_role", "escort_ship", "has_shipyard", "is_carrier" and "scan_class".
  If both are present, the new one is used. like_ship merging does the right
  thing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes between Oolite 1.73.3 and Oolite 1.73.4:
* Fixed nova mission.
* Fixed missing planet name in Constrictor Hunt mission.
* Fixed bug where subentities of sold ships could come back to haunt your log.
* When buying a ship which does not specify a HUD, the default HUD is now used
  immediately.
* Scooping can no longer overfill your cargo bay.
* Fixed some cosmetic issues with equipment list UIs.
* removeEquipment scripting method now works with damaged equipment.
* awardEquipment scripting method now works with EQ_REMOVE_MISSILES.
* Fixed spurious OXP verifier warning about display_name key.
* Hyperspeed is now turned off when dying.
* [Windows] Installer now uninstalls old versions correctly.
* [Mac] Fixed an error where random (often very loud) noise could be played
        through the right channel at the end of long sounds.
* [Mac] Game now starts in full-screen mode if it was in full-screen mode when
        last quit.
* [Non-Mac] Fixed a problem with mouse control.
* [Non-Mac] Added option to suppress splash screen, which forces the game to
            run with software rendering on some systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes between Oolite 1.73.2 and Oolite 1.73.3:
* Fixed failure on startup when two OXPs define the same equipment.
* Partial fix for bug where the system data screen showed a planet in systems
  that had gone nova.
* Fixed AI habit of trying to steal cargo right out of other ships' scoops,
  with hilarious results.
* [Mac] Docking clearance, the wormhole scanner and targeting of incoming
        missiles are now enabled.
* [Mac] Fixed incompatibility with Debug OXP.
* [Mac] Fixed minor leak in Snow Leopard resulting from the recent crash
        report enhancement.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes between Oolite 1.73 and Oolite 1.73.2:
* Fixed incorrect counting of cargo when docked, which partially resulted in
  misbehaviour of -availableCargoSpace.
* Fixed laser purchasing bug.
* Fixed bug whereby after buying an item, the equip ship screen would be
  refreshed, even if this screen had ceased to be the active one.
* Various cosmetic and spelling errors fixed (especially 'targetting').
* Improvements to Mac OS X 10.6 crash reports.
* Legacy scripts inside CARGO_SCRIPTED_ITEMs now work again. (bug #15454)
* Fixed bug that allowed players to get rich quickly by selling missiles at
  start of game and then going to the shipyard screen.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes between Oolite 1.72.2 and Oolite 1.73:
Gameplay
* Made procedurally textured planets a game option. Can be switched on/off in
  settings. (This feature is currently not available on the Mac environment.)
* Added splash screen and application icon to Windows and Linux versions.
* Added support for tangent space effects in shaders, including normal
  mapping.
* Default shader now supports normal mapping and parallax mapping options.
* Game over screen now displays ranking as well as credits.
* Made passenger carrier market a bit more interesting by rewarding long taxi
  runs. Credits paid increase exponentially with number of hops required.
  Reputation of player is also taken into account.
* Interface change: While in flight, pressing H from the local galaxy map will
  initiate hyperspace jumps - before, the player had to exit the map to do so.
* Added new equipment: Wormhole Scanner.
* Implemented targeting of nearest incoming missile. This is activated using
  Shift+T or an assigned joystick button.
* Sell/buy as much as possible on the F8 screen via Shift+left/right. Prefer
  to buy with Shift+Return.
* Time Acceleration Factor. Activated while in pause mode with left and right
  arrow keys. Can be from 1/16 to 16 times the normal time. TAF is visible in
  the FPS display.
* Raised the limit on gold, platinum and gemstones to 10000 units.
* Various AI changes. Most noticeable is that docking ships are now more
  likely to react to attacks, and less likely to crash during the final docking
  stage with bigger ships.
* Find systems on the long range chart screen: all possible matches now
  highlighted while typing.
* Last save directory is now saved in prefs; oolite-saves is only created when
  defaulting to it.
* Repositioned message row. Messages are now fully readable in standard
  Oolite.
* Equipment on the status screen now displays on multiple screens when needed,
  instead of overwriting the message and HUD areas.
* Repeating messages: after 6 seconds of displaying a message, the same
  message is shown again. They're discarded otherwise, as before.
* Game settings screen: Mac fullscreen resolution changes are now immediate.
* If no external views are defined for player ships, the cobra3 ones are used
  instead.
* The left and right square bracket keys can now be used as controls.
* Joystick hats are now supported on the Windows and Linux builds.

Expansion packs
* Icons and symbols can now be associated to beacons, and will be shown on the
  advanced compass.
* Subentity definitions in shipData can now be dictionaries.
* Removed restrictions on vertex and face counts for ship models.
* Introduced the cloak_passive ship dictionary key. When set to true (or yes),
  it will cause the cloaking device to be deactivated whenever a main weapon
  or missile is fired, making the cloak somewhat less of a superweapon.
  Default is no.
* CLASS_NO_DRAW can be used inside plists for specific (ghost?) ships again,
  as in 1.65 and before. However, the system populator still overrides
  CLASS_NO_DRAW for incoming ships.
* Customsounds.plist now accepts arrays, in a similar way to descriptions.plist.
* Added new system settings to planetinfo.plist: "sun_radius" (float),
  "sun_color" = (any colour specifier), "corona_shimmer" = (float: 0-1),
  "corona_hues" = (float: 0-1), "corona_flare" = (float: 0-1).
  Two more settings: "texture" = (string), "texture_hsb_color" = (hsb color)
  available when procedural textures are active.
* Renamed planets: %H and %I now use scripted planet names, including inside
  planet descriptions.
* Plural handling for languages with more than one plural form.
* requires_equipment, requires_any_equipment and incompatible_with_equipment
  restrictions now work for weapons.
* New %J token for string expansion: expands %J000 to %J255 to its
  corresponding system name.
* Implemented the key cloak_indicator_on_status_light in hud.plist (Off by
  default).
* Added example of drawing a yaw indicator bar (disabled by default).

Scripting
* Work towards securing legacy scripts, AIs and shader uniform bindings by
  whitelisting methods. Game will now print an error message in the log if
  non-whitelisted methods are used in legacy scripts or AIs.
* Added class ShipGroup. Groups are now defined in a different way than
  previously. ShipGroups are exposed to JS as a property of ships.
* Made time acceleration factor controllable by JavaScript using the
  read/write timeAccelerationFactor global property for bullet-time-like
  effects.
* PlayerShip.removeEquipment() now works for missiles. Also,
  awardEquipment()ing a missile when the player has none now causes the new
  missile to be selected.
* Reworked Aegis messages. sun aegis is recognised, approaching planet event
  is restored, all handlers have a planet or station as argument.
* Added the JavaScript read/write player ship property scriptedMisjump.
  Boolean value, scripted misjumps have a lifespan of one jump only. After
  that, auto reset occurs and subsequent jumps become normal ones again.
* Bounty for script added pirates and traders now follow populator rules when
  auto_ai is true.
* JavaScript system.info.xx & system.infoForSystem([present galaxy],[system
  number]).xx are read/write now. Reading infoForSystem values from outside the
  present galaxy is not supported and will return null. However, writing system
  info anywhere in all galaxies is fully supported at all times.

New event handlers:
* stationLaunchedShip(ship)
* playerWillEnterWitchspace()
* playerTargetedMissile(missile)
* playerBoughtNewShip(ship)
* arrivalReportScreenEnded()

New JavaScript methods:
* ship.setAIState()
* ship.fireECM()
* player.ship.galaxyCoordinates()
* player.ship.cursorCoordinates()
* station.dockPlayer()
* player.addMessageToArrivalReport(message)

New AI commands:
* dropMessages
* debugDumpPendingMessages
* exitAIWithMessage:
* messageSelf:
* abortAllDockings
* throwSparks
* randomPauseAI:
* launchIndependentShipWithRole:
* checkOwnLegalStatus
* setSpeedToCruiseSpeed
 
Changed commands:
* Added delay parameter to playerStartedJumpCountdown event.
* Made Entity.position and Entity.orienation read/write, and deprecated
  Entity.setPosition() and Entity.setOrientation()
* Ship.exitAI() now can specify a message. Default is RESTARTED.
* Deprecated system.goingNova and system.goneNova in favour of existing Sun
  equivalents.

Bug fixes
* Fixed far away docking of ships. Ships that start the dockingAI further away
  than 2.5 times scanner distance from a station are sent back to their
  original AI.
* SDL & Windows fixes: reworked Windows port to resize game view without
  texture loss. Splash screen for both Linux and Windows. When switching
  fullscreen resolutions using F11 Oolite now saves the new fullscreen
  resolution.
* Fixed negative cargo bug shown in shipyard for ships with cargo capacity
  less than 5t that had EQ_PASSENGER_BERTH as optional equipment.
* Oolite now takes incompatible equipment into account when generating ships
  for sale.
* Fixed weapon position. It now follows the defined position in shipData
  instead of always using the default one.
* Fixed an inconsistency in oolite-font.plist.
* Prevent ships from escorting things with different scan classes.
* Pirates returning to their own pirate cove are now correctly added to the
  station defence ships.
* Cloak no longer works as an energy generator when not cloaked.
* Escorts cannot have escorts of their own anymore. This avoids memory
  overflows in cases of recursive escort-ship, escort-role and mutual escort
  ship references between two or more ships.
* Motherships with a clean legal status now only accept clean escorts.
* Fixed hasShipyard.
* Fixed crash when max_missiles is set to higher than maximum allowed (16).
* Fixed bug in performFaceDestination where a ship would hang still in space.
* launchTrader now launches traders with correct escorts for that ship type.
* sun_radius loop bug: should now cope with all sun_radius values.
* Limited checkcourseToDestination to scanner range so it only changes course
  when it actually "sees" something.
* scanForOffenders no longer finds fellow group members.
* Minimum player-bouy distance when entering system raised from 500 to 750
  metres.
* Resolved bug that caused ships with subentities to explode inside closed
  structures and other sudden collisions near bigger ships.
* More systemInfo changes for the current system are now validated and are
  effective immediately, including most sun settings, main planet texture, and
  derivative ones (ie commodity market/economy, ship and equipment markets/
  techlevel). Properties not yet effective immediately produce a warning.
* AI command setCourseToPlanet no longer sets course to moons, only to the
  closest planet.
* Fixed joystick precision mode switch causing continuous yaw to left (Linux
  and Windows builds only).
 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes between Oolite 1.72.1 and Oolite 1.72.2:
* Fixed bug in selecting ships after a spawn condition blocked the initial
  selection. This was causing disappearing buoys and police ships with some
  OXPs.
* Fixed a bug where by flooding the market when selling a ship, cargo remained
  on the newly acquired ship even if said ship had no cargo carry capability.
  Now, all cargo that cannot be sold when changing ships due to flooding the
  market will be lost.
* Fixed an AI bug where a police ship that received a distress call while
  returning to the station could get stuck after dealing with the call.
* Fixed a bug where defense ships launched by stations had a patrol AI instead
  of a combat AI.
* Cloaking device mission now works again.
* Background images in HUD are now affected by HUD alpha (and thus HUD hiding).
* key_docking_clearance_request is now set in keyconfig.plist.
* Possible fix for texture corruption bug on Windows machines with more than
  two processors.
* Cargo pods added by scripts now have cargo.
* Fixed a problem with JavaScript system property setup.
* playerStartedJumpCountdown JS event is now always playerStartedJumpCountdown
  and never playerStartedJumpCountDown.
* Improved various error messages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes between Oolite 1.72 and Oolite 1.72.1:
Crashes:
* (Non-Mac) Fixed crash when no sound device available.
* Fixed a bug making random ship selection take unnecessarily long when script
  conditions failed - sometimes infinitely long.
* Strict play mode partially fixed - switching no longer crashes, but OXP
  world scripts keep running, which they shouldn't.
* Fixed crash when colliding with a ship whose model couldn't be loaded, and
  took steps to ensure that such ships don't exist anyway.

Game behaviour:
* Fuel now costs money as nature intended.
* Thargoid death curses no longer have infinite range.
* Tharglets created by scripts are now unpiloted.
* Probabilities for high-tech optional extras on ships are now calculated
  correctly.
* Fix for stations/carriers becoming main station in interstellar space.
* Docking clearance cancelling works as intended, and docking clearance is not
  required for escape pods.

Technicalities:
* (Mac) Enabled docking clearance system.
* Trumble sounds fixed.
* Fixed bug where going into any of the F6 screens with the injectors key
  pressed would result in injectors continuing to run even after releasing the
  key.
* SystemDescription.dot file (a tool for people translating Oolite) now
  appears in the same directory as the log on all systems.
* Possible fix for rendering problems with Windows and ATI cards (but it's a
  long shot).

Ship registry:
* Ships whose model can't be found are now dropped from the ship registry
  (with a warning message).
* is_template now works properly (specifically, ships inheriting from
  templates do not inherit the is_template value and get dropped).
* Subentities are no longer required to have roles.
* Ships with bad subentity definitions are reported and dropped.
* New ship key is_external_dependency suppresses warning when like_ships
  resolution fails. (The ship is silently dropped.)

Misc configuration:
* "hasShipyard" shipdata key now works.
* Setting a shader uniform to a constant float with short syntax (e.g.
  myUniform = 42;) in OpenStep-format property lists now works.
* Overall HUD alpha now affects comm log and message log. This also affects
  hiding the HUD ("o" key while paused).

JavaScript:
* Galactic hyperspace behaviour properties updated in accordance with documentation
  (http://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/Oolite_JavaScript_Reference:_PlayerShip#galacticHyperspaceBehaviour).
* playerBoughtEquipment event now fires even when equipment cost is 0.
* player.bounty fixed.
* player.spawnOne() now works (with deprecation warning, will be removed for
  version 1.74).
* equipmentDamaged and equipmentDestroyed events now consistently provide the
  equipment key rather than localized name.
* player.ship.setEquipmentStatus() now raises an equipmentDamaged event when
  appropriate.
* Passing invalid parameters to Sound.play(), Sound.playSound(),
  expandDescription() and displayNameForCommodity() no longer crashes Oolite.
* Ship.heatInsulation setter now works properly.
* System.infoForSystem() no longer causes delayed crash.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes between Oolite 1.71.2 and Oolite 1.72:
* New "ship registry" handles ship types and ship roles more robustly and
  efficiently. Benefits include less stutter when generating ships (especially
  traders and pirates) and various shipdata.plist errors being reported up
  front (when rebuilding cache). Also adds new shipdata-overrides.plist and
  shipyard-override.plist, which can be used to selectively override certain
  properties of ships without redefining them completely. Overrides are
  silently ignored for ships that don't have a "primary"
  shipdata.plist/shipyard.plist entry.
* New equipment type handling. This is less far-reaching than the ship
  registry, and isn't used everywhere, but it's exposed to JavaScript as
  EquipmentInfo objects (see EliteWiki for documentation).
* Missiles no longer collide with parent on launch.
* Disarmed missiles now stay disarmed when cycling through targets with
  Target System Memory Expansion.
* Workaround for key conflict in old BBC key config files: if both roll and
  yaw are assigned to ,/. keys, yaw is disabled.
* Fix for NPCs becoming offenders when counterattacking player.
* Only one energy unit is allowed at a time. Thargoid Plans mission script now
  reflects this.
* Approaching non-main planets (including the sun) no longer points compass at
  main station.
* Player ship turrets now work.
* Escort turrets now work.
* Carriers can now control their launched defenders.
* Miniature planets from F7 screen no longer float around invisibly
  mass-locking you.
* (Non-Mac) Fix failure to launch when cache is corrupt.
* Fixed rounding behaviour of some currency displays.
* Suppressed pointless "Cannot iterate into directory" messages.
* (Non-Mac) Support for joysticks with up to 16 axes and 64 buttons. If you
  need more than 16 axes, I shall require photo evidence.
* More (all?) sound goes through customsounds.plist.
* (Non-Mac) SDL sound code rewritten to be more like Mac code. Most noticeable
  effect is that more than one instance of a sound can be played at once. As a
  result, afterburner2.ogg is no longer needed.
* (Non-Mac) Logs are now written to ~/.Oolite/Logs/under Linux and
  \Oolite\Logs\ under Windows. (Oh yes, I intended to change it to GNUstep
  default locations. Oh well.) OXP verifier logs also end up there, named by
  OXP.
* (Mac only) Updated Smart Crash Reports to 1.5 for Leopard compatibility.
* Similarly, showShipModel: no longer generates escorts.
* More stuff made localizable.
* New is_template shipdata.plist property. Set this to yes/ for ships which
  are only used through like_ships and are not intended to be used directly.
  If your (otherwise working) OXP generates warnings about ships with no roles
  or model attribute, you probably need this.
* New is_submunition shipdata.plist property for cluster weapons. Missiles
  with this property inherit their launcher's current target.
* New shipdata.plist key hyperspace_motor_spin_time to modify jump countdown
  time.
* New planetinfo.plist keys star_count_multiplier and nebula_count_multiplier.
  (Can be used in universal section to modify overall star and nebula density.)
* Putting planets in interstellar space no longer breaks the game.
* Failure to set up a station is now handled somewhat more gracefully, with
  useful diagnostic log messages.
* Added commsMessageByUnpiloted: for AIs and legacy scripts.
* switchLightsOn/Off now applies to subentities.
* Fixed some spurious errors in OXP verifier.
* Condition flags for equipment are now enforced when adding items directly,
  not only when shopping. More condition flags are now available. The full
  list is: available_to_all, requires_empty_pylon, requires_mounted_pylon,
  requires_clean, requires_not_clean, portable_between_ships,
  requires_free_passenger_berth, requires_full_fuel, requires_non_full_fuel.
  Other types of condition are: requires_cargo_space, requires_equipment,
  requires_any_equipment, incompatible_with_equipment. Legacy script
  conditions can also be used (only apply to player).
* New HUD plist key reticle_target_sensitive makes target selection box go red
  when active target is in position (requires Scanner Targeting Enhancement).
  Also exposed to JS as player.ship.reticleTargetSensitive.
* Fix for the occasional 15-20 seconds slowdowns experienced during gameplay.
* Some AI tweaks from Eric, and general cleanup of AI formatting.
* Docking clearance support, see http://www.aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?t=5060
* Oolite now builds for Irix, but (last I heard) doesn't run due to threading
  issues in GNUstep.
* New shader uniform types randomFloat, randomUnitVector, randomVectorSpatial,
  randomVectorRadial and randomQuaternion (which supports asMatrix option,
  default is true).
* Various changes for 64-bit compatibility under OS X and Linux. This release
  is not 64-bit, though.
* Oolite can now correctly count CPUs under Linux, not that this makes much
  difference.
* New web site at oolite.org. (Hey, it's in the subversion log.)
* Spot the graphical tweaks!


JavaScript changes:
* Potential crashing bugs throughout JS code fixed (exceptions weren't being
  handled properly). Also added more and better JS error checking.
* missionVariables object no longer treats strings starting with digits but
  containing letters as numbers.
* AI sendScriptMessage: can now pass parameters. The AI statement
  "sendScriptMessage: foo bar baz" is equivalent to the JS
  ship.script.foo(["bar", "baz"]). Note that the parameters are passed as an
  array of words.
* Debug console now allows definitions to be split over several lines; for
  instance, you can type "this.test = function() {" on one line and
  "return 3: }" on the next. Enter an empty line to cancel multi-line input.
  Lines which are considered "incomplete" are echoed with a _ prefix instead
  of >. (Mac-only: the integrated console also supports multi-line input using
  option-return, as it always has.)
* New global function randomInhabitantsDescription(plural : Boolean) : String.
* Entity.call() is now only available when debug OXP is active.
* Entity.isValid now works for invalid entities.
* New Ship properties and methods: desiredSpeed, cargoSpaceUsed,
  availableCargoSpace, passengerCount, passengerCapacity, remove().
* Renamed Ship properties: maxCargo -> cargoCapacity, shipDescription -> name,
  shipDisplayName -> displayName.
* player split into player and player.ship. All Entity/Ship methods now live
  in player.ship. There are compatibility accessors in player, which will be
  removed in future (and generate warnings).
* New Player properties and methods: contractReputation, passengerReputation,
  increaseContractReputation(), decreaseContractReputation(),
  increasePassengerReputation(), decreasePassengerReputation(),
  reticleTargetSensitive, rank, legalStatus, forwardShield, aftShield,
  maxForwardShield, maxAftShield, forwardShieldRechargeRate,
  aftShieldRechargeRate.
* player.orientation is now right way around.
* New System properties and methods: info and infoForSystem(), equivalent to
  legact setPlanetInfo: and setSpecificPlanetInfo:. For example,
  system.info["foo"] = "bar" is equivalent to "setPlanetInfo: foo bar".
  Currently, values can only be written, not read. Also
  countShipsWithPrimaryRole(), pseudoRandomNumber, pseudoRandom100,
  pseudoRandom256.
* system.setSunNova() deprecated in favour of system.sun.goNova().
* Better error messages for legacy_addShip*() family.
* system properties now make some sort of sense in interstellar space.
* Vector renamed to Vector3D.
* Ability to pass several numbers instead of a vector or quaternion is
  deprecated. Use an array or Vector3D instead. (For instance, instead of
  ship.position.add(100, 0, 0) use ship.position.add([100, 0, 0]).)
* New script events: playerBoughtEquipment(equipmentKey),
  equipmentDamaged(eqipmentKey), equipmentDestroyed(equipmentKey).
* New events for approaching and leaving planets:
  shipEnteredPlanetaryVicinity(planet)/shipExitedPlanetaryVicinity(planet) for
  JS, CLOSE_TO_PLANET/AWAY_FROM_PLANET for AIs. (Actually, I'm not clear on
  how CLOSE_TO_PLANET differs from AEGIS_CLOSE_TO_PLANET. If none, suggest
  removing CLOSE_TO_PLANET. Kaks?)
* shipLaunchedEscapePod() is now triggered slightly earlier, before resetting
  legal status and trumbles.


NOTE: one warning generated by the ship registry is disabled by default for
the benefit of Realistic Shipyards, namely the warning when a shipyard.plist
entry does not correspond to a shipdata.plist entry. This warning will be
enabled by default in 1.73. To enable it, change
shipData.load.shipyard.unknown to yes in logcontrol.plist.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes between Oolite 1.71.1 and Oolite 1.71.2:
* Fixed delayed crash after looking at system info screen in interstellar
  space.
* Fixed crash when an array in descriptions.plist is empty.
* Suns, Q-mine explosions and wormholes are now the same size no matter which
  direction youíre looking at them from.
* Fix for ships launching with the wrong AI.
* ECM, space compass and ident are now reset properly when restarting the game.
* Fixed HUD alpha/hiddenness for empty missile slots.
* Fixed glitch where it would become impossible to stop playing music after
  attempting to play music that does not exist.
* Creating a JavaScript timer with a negative delay value now creates a paused
  timer as documented.
* Player.alertEnergy and Player.alertHostiles now work on Windows and Linux.
* Squashed spurious ìship generated with infinite top speed!î log messages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes between Oolite 1.71 and Oolite 1.71.1:
* Fixed hang when entering interstellar space.
* Cloaking device mission now works.
* Credit quantities now display correctly on big-endian systems (such as
  PowerPC Macs).
* Fixed problem with double-clicking on load/save screen.
* Growl mode strings can now be localized (Mac OS X only).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes between Oolite 1.70 and Oolite 1.71:
  Stability:
* Fixed the nasty bug that would occasionally cause Oolite to crash after
  having consumed all memory during system population.
* Fixed the selling ship with subentities causes crash bug.
* Fixed strict mode to/from crashes.
* Fixed unmarkSystem crash.
* Removed crash when loading save game with 'stale' oxp missiles (see
  http://aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?p=47921&highlight=#47921)

  JavaScript:
* All internal game scripts are now JavaScript -- adopted somewhat twiddled
  versions of Eric Walch's scripts.
* Implemented JS sound and music interface.
* Fixed scriptActionOnTarget: not setting the script target correctly (note:
  scriptActionOnTarget: is now deprecated, use safeScriptActionOnTarget:
  instead).
* Added shipHitByECM(pulsesRemaining) script event.
* Added JS systemNameForID() and systemIDForName() methods.
* JS mission.choice is now read-write, mission.resetMissionChoice() deprecated.
* Added JS Ship methods dumpCargo(), ejectItem() and ejectSpecificItem().
* Added playerEnteredNewGalaxy(newGalaxyNumber) script event.
* Added missionChoiceWasReset() script event.
* Most AI reactToMessage: calls now also have a script event; see
  http://www.aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?p=47620#47620
* Setting the player's target through JS now works as expected (locks on ident,
  with UI feedback, unless a missile is selected in which case current missile
  is locked on to the new target).
* Added Ship.explode(), which kills any ShipEntity through energy damage
  including the main station. Once again made blowing up the main station with
  blowUpMainStation (or explode()) work.
* Added experimental planet.setTexture in JavaScript. Usage restricted to
  shipWillExitWitchspace() & shipWillLaunchFromStation().

  Bugfixes:
* Fixed a serious memory leak on the short-range chart screen. Other smaller
  leaks plugged as well.
* Linux shader support added (did not work with 1.70).
* Fix for trade-ins (like selling missiles or replacing lasers) not working.
* Fix for scripting bug, whereby when adding a second ship to the system with
  the same script that was active before, all references to player, system,
  mission, worldScript etc. were gone and using them was giving an error in
  the log.
* Fixed the "too many saved games in oolite-saves causes weird behavior" bug.
* Fix for OXP verifier turning off log message classes.
* Fix for bug where awardEquipment:EQ_TRUMBLE while a trumble infection is in
  progress would innoculate the player against future trumble infections. Also
  added code to un-innoculate existing saved games.
* Fixed laser purchasing mishandling bug in equip ship screen.
* Fixed a small bug that was there since 1.65, whereby switching to equip ship
  screen would sometimes display information for equipment other than the
  normally selected missile.
* Fixed bug where purchasing a ship with an upgraded laser does not reward the
  laser (bug #12791).
* Fixed bug whereby when docked with a non-primary station, the New Game option
  would be unreachable in the menu, although it was shown as available.
* Fix for Asps not having lasers when bought.
* Fuel injectors on NPC ships are not allowed any more if we are on strict
  mode.
* Made newly added ship entities get crews only if they are not scanClass
  CLASS_CARGO or CLASS_ROCK. This way, when scooping scripted cargopods or
  boulders, for example, the correct scooped commodity is diplayed, instead of
  messages of the type 'You have captured a slave'.
* Reverted laser rendering to mode where lasers are clearly visible against the
  sun.
* Resolved music not looping problem in SDL builds.
* Station defense Viper's AI fixed and deafult maximum number of station
  defenders launched when station is under attack increased from 3 to 8. Key
  max_police sets the main stations defenders / number of system patrols.
* Sticky messages bug has been most likely fixed.
* Fixed bug for APPROACHING_SURFACE returning incorrect results.
* Shuttles now take off directly away from the planet (bug #12212).
* Bugfix for very long passenger names in the Carrier Market.
* Fixed bug where scripted cargo pods do not award cargo as expected when
  scooped (bug #12659).
* Added the CLASS_CARGO scan class to alloy and splinter in shipdata.plist, so
  that they don't appear unscoopable and with legal status when spawned by
  scripts.
* Better diagnostics for bad AIs.
* JavaScript legacy_addShipsWithinRadius method fixed and works as expected.
* Fixed Thargoid death broadcast.
* Demo screen behavior has now been fully fixed. No more ships going past the
  screen on game startup. Missing/broken ship models displayed as question
  marks, missing textures displayed as no-textures-material.  No comms message
  will be received when on Demo2 screen.
* Comms log now works as expected. First in, first out.
* Repairing a damaged weapon (awarded via oxp) doesn't add an extra weapon
  anymore (bugs #13471 & #13481).
* Shipyard techlevel bugfix. It now works as described in the wiki (i.e.
  techlevel=5 will allow ships to appear for sale in systems with technological
  level 6)
* JS Bugfix: changes to local system properties (tech level, government,
  etc...) now take effect immediately.
* Oolite now gives the right message when trying to jump more than 7 ly.
* Added code to hopefully work around sky rendering glitch on S3 hardware.
 
  Improvements:
* Improve speed of traversing saved games list by writing the current system
  name in the save file. When Oolite displays summary information about the
  saved game, it will try to look for this string. If the current system name
  string does not exist, it will fall back to using galaxy seed and coordinates
  to extract the system name.
* Great improvement in escort AI.
* Oolite's sound system rewritten for maximum flexibility. Most sounds now go
  through customsounds.plist.
* Changed several built-in plists to OpenStep format.
* Mission choices are now sorted.
* Legacy foo_actions can now have local variables, which are cleared when the
  _actions completes.
* Special cargo expanded and amended: it can now be saved, and no containers
  can be loaded on board while the special cargo is in the hold - scooping
  cargo will not work, and purchasing & awardCargo are only allowed for small
  valuables.
* Implemented power braking for ridiculous speeds.
* awardEquipment: if undamaged equipment present, trying to assign its damaged
  equivalent will fail with a warning. Trying to award an undamaged weapon
  using awardEquipment() will also fail with a warning.

  New Features:
* Added ability to explicitly bind shaders to subentity rather than root
  entity.
* Added support for hull heat glow to default shader (full shader mode only).
* Added support for constant vector and quaternion uniforms for shaders.
* Implemented analog joystick yaw control code. Many more analog joystick
  improvements (SDL builds only).
* Added Eric Walch's list of pre-existing roles to pirate-victim-roles.plist.
* Intergalactic jump destinations have been made user/scripter controllable.
* Missiles now use the accuracy variable to determine how well to track
  targets. Accuracy must be between 0.0 and 10.0. If not specified, it defaults
  to 0.0, which corresponds to standard missile accuracy.
* All game strings are now externalized and easily changeable by the user.
* Added support for 8-bit character encoding, thus enabling Oolite's
  internationalization. Oolite now has built-in support for Western European
  (Latin-1) text and Greek, Cyrillic, Turkish and Eastern European (Latin-2)
  "starter kit" OXPs are now available.
* Made the equipment.plist array mergeable like a dictionary, thus enabling OXP
  created equipment to override the standard one instead of being added on top
  of it.
* Added support for 'abs' co-ordinate system.
* Added auto_ai support for escort set-up.
* Added script events for planet and station proximity events.
* Added full support for aft lasers in shipyard. Side lasers should work if
  defined in a plist, but we don't offer random "upgrades" to them in the
  shipyard (bugs #012362 and #012363).
* Added Autosave option in the game options sub-menu.
* Graphics fiddle: scarred alloy is now only scarred on one side, and has a
  specular intensity map (if shaders enabled); both types of alloy are now
  shinier.
* Oolite now supports multiple textures for nebulae and stars; also uses mix of
  sun and star colours for ambient light.
* Added overall_alpha key to HUD dictionaries, defaulting to 75% opacity (25%
  transparency).
* HUD can now be switched off with the 'o' key and turned on again with the 'n'
  key while game is paused.

  Miscellaneous:
* Subentities no longer count as kills.
* Made ship AI send a beingAttacked message to scripts when a missile is fired
  against ship.
* Most legacy script methods now show the name of the current script if an
  error occurs, but this only works for world scripts.
* Change to Console.consoleMessage: ConsoleMessage('message') is now shorthand
  for consoleMessage('command-result','message').
* Ejected items and debris are now spawned with 85% of the parent's cabin
  temperature.
* Weapon mounting positions with weapons already mounted are now shown in a
  darker green color in the equip ship screen.
* Game over changes: After the player ship has been destroyed, game restarts at
  Lave, pulse laser only, 100Cr.
* Energy unit changes: energy units recharge rate adjusted to offer a better
  challenge to the player, and naval/extra energy unit purchase behaviour more
  flexible (see resolution of Bug #13507, Naval Energy Unit bug in berlios).
* Warnings added if energy units are going to be removed.
* Made the required Advanced Nav Array tech level equal to 7, as it was meant
  to be.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes between Oolite 1.69.1.1 and Oolite 1.70:
* Greatly enhanced JavaScript scriptability. Ships and planets are now
  scriptable objects. Every ship now has an attached JavaScript script. Added
  timers and clock object. The system object provides flexible methods for
  searching for entities.
* Implemented interactive JavaScript/debug console. Under Mac OS X, this is
  integrated into the application (when a special OXP is installed). On all
  platforms, the game can communicate with a separate console program over TCP.
  Writing a good console is left as a third-party opportunity.
* Added -verify-oxp command-line option.
* Fixed inconsistent usage of "role" attribute by splitting it into a set of
  roles and a primary role.
* New extendable property list, pirate-victim-roles.plist, specifies which
  (primary) roles pirates will look for when selecting victims. This allows OXP
  developers to make their special ships potential victims.
* Integrated Commander McLane's external views OXP. It is recommended that the
  OXP be removed when running Oolite 1.70.
* Added travel time estimate for stars within one jump.
* Split game options out of menu.
* Added option to play in wireframe mode.
* Added option to set shader complexity level (Off/Simple/Full) on shader-
  capable systems.
* Added default shader, used for all ships in full-shader mode and for
  materials with smoothing or options in simple-shader mode. Added material
  options for illumination mapping, glow mapping and specular mapping,
  currently only implemented with shaders. Made all ships slightly shiny by
  default.
* New AI methods:
  scanForNearestShipWithPrimaryRole: (new, preferred name for
  scanForNearestShipWithRole:)
  scanForNearestShipWithAnyPrimaryRole:
  scanForNearestShipWithoutPrimaryRole:
  scanForNearestShipHavingRole:
  scanForNearestShipHavingAnyRole:
  scanForNearestShipNotHavingRole:
  scanForNearestShipWithScanClass:
  scanForNearestShipWithoutScanClass:
  sendScriptMessage:
* Converted several plists to OpenStep format for legibility, and cleaned up
  some redundant information from shipdata.plist.
* Updated JavaScript engine. JavaScript 1.7 is now supported.
* Legacy script methods awardFuel: and setFuelLeak: now work on the current
  script target, not always the player.
* Fixed bug where local planetinfo overrides were not being restored from saved
  games properly.
* Fixed bug where several shipdata attributes were ignored for stations (bug
  #11684). Added has_npc_traffic attribute to suppress NPC traffic at carriers.
* Fixed bug with stars and nebulae looking wrong when inside an atmosphere.
* Fixed trumble-related crash.
* Added clearMissionScreen scripting method to simplify mission screens.
* Several AI bug fixes contributed by Eric Walch.
* Fix for a certain class of AI crashes (recursive reactToMessage:).
* Made evil XML DTD swizzling hack work with plists generated under
  Mac OS X 10.5.
* Made asteroids created by scripts behave the same as asteroids created by the
  system populator.
* Fixed bug where cancelling the Open Game dialog caused broken behaviour
  (Mac OS X only; bug #11691).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
Changes between Oolite 1.69.1 and 1.69.1.1:
* Fixed a consistent crash at startup on x86-based Macs.
        
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
Changes between Oolite 1.69b and 1.69.1:
* Several crashes and other severe bugs fixed.
* Fix for a wide class of potential crashes and strange behaviours which were
  latent in earlier versions but obscured by an otherwise unhelpful caching
  mechanism.
* Fix for ship death_actions and script_actions not working.
* Fix for awardCredits: stealing all your money.
* Fix for shipyard refusing to sell ships whose price is less than your current
  trade-in value.
* Added notequal operator to legacy scripting system.
* Reduced trade-in values by 25% across the board to reduce market exploits.
* Temporarily disabled procedurally textured planets to avoid a crashing bug.
* Fix for problem with ships that have multiple common roles being created
  by scripts and having the wrong AI, as discussed at
  http://www.aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?t=3654 .
* Better handling of out-of-range numbers in property lists.
* Fix for JavaScript methods randomly not doing anything. Also fixed
  system.legacyAddShipsWithinRadius() ignoring radius parameter.
* Fix for scripts running while paused, if on a menu screen.
* Fix for wrong galaxy being shown when switching from Open screen to Map
  screen.
* Fix for out-of-range laser heat value in shaders on demo screen.
* Damaged equipment is now shown in orange as intended.
* Big yellow question mark is now shown as intended on the Open screen when
  selecting a saved game using an unavailable ship.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
Changes between Oolite 1.69 and 1.69b:
* Fixed an error that caused certain scripts tied to ships not to run.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes between Oolite 1.68 and 1.69:
* New materials model and more flexibility for shaders.
* Lasers can now be any colour, with the limitation that they must be
  reasonably bright. The new colour spec syntax introduced for lasers is also
  supported for sky colours, but not planets in this release.
* Raised vertex and face counts for meshes, while reducing memory usage.
* Reformatted keyconfig.plist to be more legible and easier to edit.
* Advanced Navigation Array default key changed to ^ (shift-6 on UK keyboards)
  to avoid surprise launches.
* Save/load screens now show more information, and show the correct ship type
  even if it isnít currently installed (only applies to games saved with 1.69
  or later). Also, a question mark is now shown in place of unknown ships (but
  looks bad due to bugs in setting up smoothed models).
  Under Mac OS X, this only applies in full-screen mode as standard system
  dialogs are used in windowed mode.
* The commander status screen now shows damaged equipment in orange.
* The appearance of interstellar space is now set in planetinfo.plist.
* (Mac OS X only) Support for a new Debug menu added. It is enabled by a
  special OXP, Debug Menu.oxp.
* New debugging key, key_dump_target_state, which dumps a lot of information
  about the playerís target (or the player, if there is no target) to the log.
  Not bound to anything by default.
* New requires.plist key added: max_version. This is not expected to be useful
  very often, except for Debug Menu.oxp. Any unknown keys in required.plist
  will now cause an OXP not to load.
* Improved robustness in various ways, especially with regards to property
  list parsing.
* Various redundant bits of code removed; code cleanup; some optimization.
* Cache is no longer pruned at all. Since itís rebuilt when OXPs are changed,
  the maximum size of the cache is limited by the installed OXPs. In practice,
  sizes of a few MB can be expected. Under GNUstep, cache read/write should be
  more efficient and the folder the cache lives in will be created if needed.
* Under Mac OS X and Windows, you can force a cache rebuild by holding down
  shift during start-up. This probably sort of works on Linux other systems if
  you press it just at the right moment.
* Fixed various issues under Linux (catching up with changes since pre 1.67).
* (Mac OS X only) Spotlight indexer indexes name of ship for games saved with
  1.69 or later
