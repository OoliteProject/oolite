Stuff Fixed during Porting
==========================

The purpose of this file is to list the things I came up against,
how I fixed them, and what caused them so if you're porting to
another platform and see something similar, you know where to start
looking (rather than groping in the dark). It is grouped into 'Symptom'
and 'Cause'. The cause discussion includes possible solutions.

If you are porting to another platform, and you encounter weird difficulties
that you overcome please add them to this file and either send it to me,
or if you have svn commit access to the repo, commit it.

Symptom:
Altitude bar drawn right across the screen, time under the scanner
showing stupid value (it should be something like NNNNNNN:NN:NN:NN),
probably no rotating Cobra showing on startup (and no view out of the
window when you launch your ship)

Cause:
Bad maths.
floor(), part of the standard C math library, is returning funny values
or your int type is not at least 32 bits wide.
Make sure #include <math.h> is done in all applicable files; for Linux
this was put in oolite-linux.h which is included by every file.

Check that floor() returns a sensible value by writing a short program that
does:

int result;
double thing=180058016009.741669;
result=floor(thing / 86400.0);
printf("Result is %d and thing is %f\n", result, thing);

Result should equal 2084004. Try it including math.h and not including
math.h and note any differences. If it gives the right result with math.h
but the wrong result without, then you've not included math.h

In the case that your int type is only 16 bits, this will probably work:
#define int long

and put it in your equivalent of oolite-linux.h.

Additional info: see the manpage for floor().

TODO: Include an assertion on startup that causes the game to exit
immediately with an error message describing the problem if floor()
doesn't return the correct value. I'll only bother if this problem
keeps cropping up. An error message that can be reported is much
better than a vague description of these symptoms by some guy who
just wants to play the game.

Symptom: Floating point exceptions

Cause: Some rhs of / and % expressions are turning out to be zero (I
assume this isn't the case on OS X). In some instances, the simple
fix of doing an if(rhs_of_expression)... before the div or mod
operation is appropriate. It's probably best to look for the root
cause of why the rhs is zero in the first place to check that it's not
harmless and you're not going to hide a new problem or hide the root
cause by doing this test.

The location of the exception is easily found by doing 'make debug=yes'
and doing 'debugapp oolite.debug' and then looking at the line of code
it crashes in.

Sound in general: gnustep_sndd crashes

Cause: Don't know, assume it's a bug in GNUstep.

This has been fixed by subclassing NSSound (since the AIFF loader is
fine) and replacing the actual sound output/mixer by using SDL.
