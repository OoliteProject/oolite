		Most of the text in the game comes from description.plist. It is
	    processed in different ways in different contexts.
	 
		In general, the following expansions are possible:
		  %H - "homeworld", the name of the current system.
		  %I - The possessive form of the current system's name, in English
		       homeworld+ian.
		  %R - random word. Use %N instead for any new strings.
		  %N - better random word.
		  %@ - Placeholder for text to be inserted by the game.
		  %d, %.1f etc. - placeholders for numbers, using printf syntax.
		  [$text] - will be replaced with variable $text provided by the
		            game or a script. If no matching variable is provided, the
			        key $text will be looked up in descriptions.plist. The
		            following variabes are always(ish) available:
		              commander_name
		              commander_shipname (the type of the ship)
		              commander_shipdisplayname
		              commander_rank ("Mosty Harmless", etc)
		              commander_legal_status ("Clean", etc)
		              commander_bounty
		              credits_number
		            [$text] expansions can have one or more formatting operators
		            appended using a pipe character: [text|operator1|operator2].
		            The supported operators are:
		              cr - Formats a number as a credits value, with one decimal
		                   place.
		              dcr - Decicredits: like cr, but divides the number by 10.
		              icr - Integer credits: like cr, but with no decimal place.
		              idcr – Integer decicredits: divides a number by ten,
		                     rounds the result to an integer, then like icr.
		              precision:N - Converts a number to a string with n decimal
		                     places.
		              multiply:N - Multiplies a number with N.
		              add:N - Adds N to a number.
		            Example: if foo = 10, the operator sequence
		            [foo|multiply:0.3333333|add:2|precision:2] produces "5.33".
		  [$number] = a random line from item $number of system_description
		              (defined below) is is used.

	// Plural-form handling.
	// * The format is an array of rules, each one a string, as set out below.
	// * |index| is, by default, 0 for the first rule.
	//   It is incremented by 1 for each following rule.
	// * |index| is returned if a rule is matched.
	// * |index|+1 (wrt the last rule) is returned if none are matched.
	// * The input is always an integer, and should be -1 if a plural should
	//   be used but the quantity is indeterminate.
	// * Each rule is a string containing a list of commands and/or
	//   conditions, whitespace-separated:
	//		#n		command		index = n
	//							affects following rules, is still incremented
	//		~		command		remaining conditions' results are inverted
	//							rest of this rule only; second time cancels
	//		%n		command		input %= n
	//							rest of this rule only; n >= 2
	//		=n		condition	input == n
	//		!n		condition	input != n
	//		<n		condition	input < n
	//		>n		condition	input > n
	// * Parsing of the rule stops at the first false condition.
	//   #n is therefore normally only useful in one of two places in any rule:
	//   - the start, so that it always affects following rules;
	//   - the end, so that it affects only this rule.
	// * All conditions must be true for the rule to be true.
	// * If you require either of two conditions, you need two rules.
	//   The second rule will require use of #n.
	// * Suffix your tokens with "%n", e.g. "item%0"="item", "item%1"="items".
	// * If the plural rule list is undefined, you will get English rules.
	// * If the plural rule list is empty, you will get index 0.
