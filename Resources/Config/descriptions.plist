	// Plural-form handling.
	// * The format is an array of rules, each one a string, as set out below.
	// * |index| is, by default, 0 for the first rule.
	//   It is incremented by 1 for each following rule.
	// * |index| is returned if a rule is matched.
	// * |index|+1 (wrt the last rule) is returned if none are matched.
	// * The input is always an integer, and should be -1 if a plural should
	//   be used but the quantity is indeterminate.
	// * Each rule is a string containing a list of commands and/or
	//   conditions, whitespace-separated:
	//		#n		command		index = n
	//							affects following rules, is still incremented
	//		~		command		remaining conditions' results are inverted
	//							rest of this rule only; second time cancels
	//		%n		command		input %= n
	//							rest of this rule only; n >= 2
	//		=n		condition	input == n
	//		!n		condition	input != n
	//		<n		condition	input < n
	//		>n		condition	input > n
	// * Parsing of the rule stops at the first false condition.
	//   #n is therefore normally only useful in one of two places in any rule:
	//   - the start, so that it always affects following rules;
	//   - the end, so that it affects only this rule.
	// * All conditions must be true for the rule to be true.
	// * If you require either of two conditions, you need two rules.
	//   The second rule will require use of #n.
	// * Suffix your tokens with "%n", e.g. "item%0"="item", "item%1"="items".
	// * If the plural rule list is undefined, you will get English rules.
	// * If the plural rule list is empty, you will get index 0.

So far, it has only been practical to produce in relatively small quantities.";

	"oolite-ship-library-description-gecko"		= "The Gecko is an extremely effective combat ship, not far behind the Asp in effectiveness but considerably easier to maintain - the space saved by not fitting a witchdrive means that far less miniaturisation is required for the remaining components.

	"oolite-ship-library-description-krait"		= "The Krait is an old light fighter design, originally made in the millions, but rarely produced today. Its only remaining advantage is ease of customisation - the Mamba has superseded it in almost every niche as a light fighter.";

	"oolite-ship-library-description-qbomb"		= "The Quirium Cascade Mine is an extremely powerful timed weapon, rarely used by civilians due to its ability to destroy a wide area including the launching ship.

	"oolite-ship-library-description-sidewinder"	= "An excellent light fighter often deployed by military forces to support larger ships such as the Asp, it is also commonly used by trading corporations as an escort fighter. Pirates rarely use this ship as its military heritage makes it difficult to maintain.";
	"oolite-ship-library-description-tharglet"	= "The Thargon Drone fighter is carried in large numbers by Thargoid warships. It is lightly armed and fragile, though its tiny size makes it almost impossible to hit.

	"oolite-ship-library-description-transporter"	= "The Transporter is the most common ship used for in-system cargo and personnel transfers, with more range and capacity than the orbital shuttle. It is usually unarmed, though some fit a mining laser to make asteroid mining more efficient.";
	"oolite-ship-library-description-viper"	= "The Viper patrol craft is seen in every system - in greater or lesser numbers - protecting the space lanes and the Cooperative stations. Its design is starting to show its age especially against modern fighter craft, but most criminals will still retreat when confronted by a full patrol wing.";
	"oolite-ship-library-description-viperinterceptor"	= "This next generation police fighter has recently been introduced as a replacement for the aging Viper design. Expensive to build and maintain, it is rarely seen except in the richest systems, where it is extremely effective in securing the space lanes against piracy.";
	"oolite-ship-library-description-worm"	= "A light transport craft similar to the orbital shuttle in capacity but with a longer range. Its weapon mounting is usually used by miners for a cheap mining ship, but particularly desperate pilots have been known to fit it with a pulse laser and use it as a (very) light escort craft.";
