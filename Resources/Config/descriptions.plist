	// Plural-form handling.
	// * The format is an array of rules, each one a string, as set out below.
	// * |index| is, by default, 0 for the first rule.
	//   It is incremented by 1 for each following rule.
	// * |index| is returned if a rule is matched.
	// * |index|+1 (wrt the last rule) is returned if none are matched.
	// * The input is always an integer, and should be -1 if a plural should
	//   be used but the quantity is indeterminate.
	// * Each rule is a string containing a list of commands and/or
	//   conditions, whitespace-separated:
	//		#n		command		index = n
	//							affects following rules, is still incremented
	//		~		command		remaining conditions' results are inverted
	//							rest of this rule only; second time cancels
	//		%n		command		input %= n
	//							rest of this rule only; n >= 2
	//		=n		condition	input == n
	//		!n		condition	input != n
	//		<n		condition	input < n
	//		>n		condition	input > n
	// * Parsing of the rule stops at the first false condition.
	//   #n is therefore normally only useful in one of two places in any rule:
	//   - the start, so that it always affects following rules;
	//   - the end, so that it affects only this rule.
	// * All conditions must be true for the rule to be true.
	// * If you require either of two conditions, you need two rules.
	//   The second rule will require use of #n.
	// * Suffix your tokens with "%n", e.g. "item%0"="item", "item%1"="items".
	// * If the plural rule list is undefined, you will get English rules.
	// * If the plural rule list is empty, you will get index 0.
