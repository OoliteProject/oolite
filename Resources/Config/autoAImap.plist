/*
	autoAImap.plist
	
	This file specifies the AIs to use for certain roles for ships with the
	auto_AI property. It is possible to expand this in OXPs to handle custom
	roles, but don't forget to prefix your custom roles with a unique
	identifier (such as your name), like all global symbols and file names.
	
	The effect of auto_AI is this: when a ship with auto_AI is added by role,
	its role is looked up in autoAImap.plist. If a match is found, the ship's
	AI is changed to the result. Normal system set-up, station launches and so
	on override this, so it mainly applies to ships generated by scripts. This
	is primarily useful when generating ships with basic roles like "trader"
	and "pirate", since a single ship may be used in multiple roles.
