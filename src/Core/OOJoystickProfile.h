OOJoystickProfile.h

JoystickProfile maintains settings such as deadzone and the mapping
from joystick movement to response.

JoystickSpline manages the mapping of the physical joystick movements
to the joystick response.  It holds a series of control points, with
the points (0,0) and (1,1) being assumed. It then interpolates
splines between the set of control points - the segment between (0,0)
and the first control point is linear, the remaining segments
quadratic with the gradients matching at the control point.
