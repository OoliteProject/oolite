OOLogOutputHandler.h
By Jens Ayton

Output handler for OOLogging.

This does two things:
1. It writes log output to ~/Logs/Oolite/Latest.log under Mac OS X or
   ~/.Oolite/Logs/Latest.log under Linux, handling thread serialization.
2. It installs a filter to capture NSLogs and convert them to OOLogs. This is
   different to the macro in OOLogging.h, which acts at compile time; the
   filter catches logging in included frameworks.

OOLogOutputHandlerPrint() is thread-safe. Other functions are not.
