# Oolite

## Installation

### Mac OS X

Oolite requires Mac OS X 10.5 or later

Drag the 'Oolite' folder (containing Oolite, this ReadMe, the License and the 'AddOns' folder) to any convenient place on your hard drive. If you are upgrading from a previous version of Oolite then drag the Oolite application from this disk's Oolite folder to your own Oolite folder.

To run the game, double-click on the file 'Oolite.app' (the Oolite icon) in the 'Oolite' folder.

### Windows

A folder called 'Oolite' has been created in Start -> Program Files. This folder has icons for running the game, the reference sheet, the link to the official Oolite website, the Advice for New Commanders guide, this ReadMe and an uninstall program.

To run the game, choose the Oolite icon in the 'Oolite' folder.

### Linux *(oolite.space package)*

*(this section is not applicable for installed packages downloaded from Linux repositories)*

For all freedesktop.org-compliant desktops (e.g. GNOME, KDE, etc.) an 'Oolite (oolite.org)' entry has been created, under the 'Games' application category. Note that a plain 'Oolite' entry, instead of 'Oolite (oolite.org)', indicates an Oolite installation performed using a package downloaded from a Linux repository. Linux repositories often lag behind the latest official application releases. It is recommended to download and install the latest Oolite version available at [https://www.oolite.space](http://www.oolite.org/).

To run the game, choose the 'Oolite (oolite.org)' entry.

Oolite may also run from a terminal. For system-wide Oolite installations (i.e. Oolite installed as root), open a terminal and execute

$ oolite

while for home-folder Oolite installations, open a terminal and execute

$ ~/GNUstep/Applications/Oolite/oolite

To remove Oolite, for system-wide installations (i.e. Oolite installed as root), open a terminal and execute

$ /opt/Oolite/uninstall

while for home-folder Oolite installations, open a terminal and execute

$ ~/GNUstep/Applications/Oolite/uninstall

For more information, on the Oolite for Linux installation, check the README.TXT file located in the following folder:

system-wide Oolite installation /opt/Oolite/doc/README.TXT

home-folder Oolite installation ~/GNUstep/Applications/Oolite/doc/README.TXT

## Start Menu

When starting Oolite, a menu with six options will be displayed.

### Start New Commander

Start a new commander. Three starting scenarios are available by default, though expansion packs may add more. New players may wish to start with the Tutorial scenario which introduces the basics of flight and combat. A commander started with the Strict Mode option will never have any expansion packs affecting the game-play, even if these are installed at a later stage.

### Load Commander

Load an existing commander file.

### View Ship Library

View the specifications and descriptions of the ships and other common space objects.

### Game Options

Opens the Game Options screen to allow for game settings to be viewed and changed (See Game Options below for more details).

### Manage Expansion Packs

Install and remove mod packs. Not all mod packs can be installed and removed by this method – others, especially older ones, can be found at [https://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/OXP\_List](http://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/OXP_List).

### Exit Game

Exit the game.

## Controls and Commands

The current keyboard configuration can be edited by selecting “Keyboard Configuration” from the “Game Options” menu.

Oolite for Mac OS X is mostly controlled from the keyboard and joystick, although the mouse can also be used in full screen mode.

Oolite for Windows and Linux can be controlled from the keyboard, joystick or mouse.

The list below describes the default key settings.

## Changing user preferences in Windows / Linux

### The user preferences defaults file .GNUstepDefaults

The current settings for the following 'Game Options...' menu entries:

* Autosave (Off/On)
* Sound Volume (Mute to 100% in increments of 5%)
* Music mode (Off/On)
* Full Screen Mode and Display Resolutions
* Wireframe Graphics (Off/On)
* Graphics Detail (Minimum, Normal, Shaders Enabled, Extra)
* Gamma correction (0.02 to 4.0 in increments of 0.02)
* Field Of View (30° to 80° in 20 increments)
* Javascript Runtime (in mib)

are stored in the file (created after Oolite first execution) .GNUstepDefaults and is stored in the following folder:

Windows: *<Oolite installation folder>*/oolite.app/GNUstep/Defaults/.GNUstepDefaults

Linux: ~/GNUstep/Defaults/.GNUstepDefaults *(Note: filenames starting with '.' are considered hidden by default in Linux)*

The recommended way to change these settings is to use the in-game options menu. Troubleshooting or the need to experiment with more advanced options, may lead to directly editing the .GNUstepDefaults file. For the changes to take effect, the .GNUstepDefaults file must be edited and saved before executing Oolite. Windows and Linux differentiate on the file format used. Windows is using the OpenStep format, which is easy to read, while Linux is using the XML format, which is more flexible.

See below a couple of examples on how to directly edit the preferences file for both Windows and Linux. The examples focus in changing from windowed mode to full screen mode at a given resolution, by setting the 'display\_width' and 'display\_height' values, and ensuring the 'fullscreen' property is set to 'YES'.

### Example 1 of 2

The following settings will give a full screen display of 800x600, one quarter sound volume, wireframe graphics enabled, and graphics detail with simple shader effects enabled:

*(Note that if the 'fullscreen' property is set to 'NO', Oolite will read the 'window\_height' and 'window\_width' parameter values and will start in a 640x480 window.)*

{

NSGlobalDomain = {

};

oolite = {

detailLevel = 2;

display\_width = 800;

display\_height = 600;

fullscreen = YES;

volume\_control = 0.25;

window\_height = 480;

window\_width = 640;

"wireframe-graphics" = YES;

};

}

## Example 2 of 2

The following settings will give a full screen display of 1400x1050, full sound volume, wireframe graphics will be replaced by textured surfaces, the Javascript runtime will be set to 64mb (default is 32mb), and extra graphics detail with full effects active:

{

NSGlobalDomain = {

};

oolite = {

detailLevel = 3;

display\_width = 1400;

display\_height = 1050;

fullscreen = YES;

"jsruntime-size-mib" = 64;

volume\_control = 1;

window\_height = 480;

window\_width = 640;

"wireframe-graphics" = NO;

};

}

There are quite a few other settings that can be used inside .GNUstepDefaults and that do not have a relevant Oolite menu entry.

For example:

"use-texture-lod-bias" = NO;

"splash-screen" = NO;

"mouse-control-in-windowed-mode" = YES;

For more information please refer to [https://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/Hidden\_Settings\_in\_Oolite](http://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/Hidden_Settings_in_Oolite) .

## Test Builds

Starting with Oolite 1.77 there are two different versions of the game. A normal version without debugging tools and a slightly slower version with debugging options that can be used with the console. This test build version will be useful for oxp developers.

The test builds have the following extra features:

* When pressing **Shift-F**, the FPS display will show additional info, including a TAF indicator.
* A console can be used, to type in JavaScript commands, interfacing directly with the Oolite universe and its entities.
* The following debugging options are accessible while paused:

**0** Dump a list of all entities in the log-file.

**b** Enable collision test debugging.

**c** Enables octree debugging.

**d** Enables all debug flags.

**s** Enables shader debug messages.

**x** Enables drawing of bounding boxes around all entities.

**n** Disables all debug flags and displays HUD again.

**left** and r**ight** cursor keys Halves/Doubles Time Acceleration Factor.

Your feedback is essential to keep improving Oolite.

A lot of effort has been put in making Oolite stable. In the, nowadays rare, event Oolite crashes, it will be highly appreciated if you let us know by raising an issue at <https://github.com/OoliteProject/oolite/issues> or by creating a topic in trhe “Testing and Bug reports” section of the Oolite Bulletin Board, found here: <https://bb.oolite.space/viewforum.php?f=3>. In both cases, attaching the crash log can be very helpful in solving problems. It is located at

Windows: *<Oolite installation folder>*/oolite.app/Logs/Latest.log

Linux: ~/.Oolite/Logs/Latest.log

Mac OS X: ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/Oolite.crash.log

Be encouraged to drop by the Oolite Bulletin Board at https://bb.oolite.space to give feedback and chat about the game. It’s the friendliest place this side of Riedquat!

**We are immensely grateful to all the people who have been testing Oolite and tediously bringing it towards perfection.**

**Thank you all!**
